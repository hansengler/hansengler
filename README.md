- 👋 Hi, I’m @hansengler, a retired mathematician.
- 👀 I’m interested in mathematics, statistics, and scientific applications in climate science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use RStudio with GitHub and other cloud repositories such as NextCloud.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data science projects that involve mathematical and statistical modeling, preferably related to climate and environment.
